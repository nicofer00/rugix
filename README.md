Rugix is an open-source tool suite for building robust, Linux-powered products. It consists of two tools:

- [**Rugix Ctrl**](https://github.com/rugix/rugix): On-device update engine. Deploy updates with confidence, never bricking a device.
- [**Rugix Bakery**](https://github.com/rugix/rugix-bakery): Custom Linux build system. Build OTA-ready images in days, not months.

Use both together for a complete solution, or integrate Rugix Ctrl into your existing Yocto or Buildroot workflow.

## Rugix Ctrl

This repository contains Rugix Ctrl, a state-of-the-art update and state management engine:

- **A/B Updates**: Atomic system updates with automatic rollback on failure.
- **Delta Updates**: [Highly-efficient delta updates](https://rugix.org/blog/efficient-delta-updates) minimizing bandwidth.
- **Signature Verification**: Cryptographic verification _before_ installing anything anywhere.
- **State Management**: Flexible state management inspired by container-based architectures.
- **Vendor-Agnostic**: Compatible with [various fleet management solutions](https://rugix.org/docs/ctrl/advanced/fleet-management) (avoids lock-in).
- **Flexible Boot Flows**: Supports [any bootloader and boot process](https://rugix.org/docs/ctrl/advanced/boot-flows).
- **Yocto Integration**: [Ready-made Yocto layers](https://github.com/rugix/meta-rugix) available.

Rugix Ctrl supports different update strategies (symmetric A/B, asymmetric with recovery, incremental updates) and can be adapted to almost any requirements you may have for robust and secure updates.

Works with Yocto, Buildroot, and other Linux build systems.

[For details, check out Rugix Ctrl's documentation.](https://rugix.org/docs/ctrl)

## Rugix Bakery

Robust over-the-air updates require system images built to support atomic updates. Traditional tools like Yocto are powerful but complex to set up and maintain, often taking teams months to build a production-ready pipeline. This complexity also creates risk: often only one person at a company truly understands the setup.

[**Rugix Bakery**](https://github.com/rugix/rugix-bakery) makes building OTA-ready system images (almost) **as easy as writing a Dockerfile**. Spend your time on what provides value to your users, not system-level details and build pipeline complexity.

[For details, check out the Rugix Bakery repository and documentation.](https://github.com/rugix/rugix-bakery)

## Why Rugix?

**Rugix is fully open-source**, including all features like delta updates. We integrate with different fleet management solutions and build systems, so **you stay in control without vendor lock-in**.

Rugix empowers teams to **ship robust products fast and without compromising on best practices** like read-only root filesystems, atomic OTA updates, and reproducible builds.
